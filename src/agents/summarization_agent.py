                        Given the following context, analyze the papers to produce a structured summary:

                        Previous conversation:
                        {chat_history}

                        {context}

                        Guidelines for timeline-based summarization:

                        Key Findings and Trends Over Time

                        Identify major discoveries and conclusions, highlighting how they have developed chronologically.
                        Note emerging trends, consensus, and any evolving contradictions across papers, especially in response to new technologies or shifts in the field.
                        Present statistical evidence and experimental results in relation to time, pointing out any measurable improvements or declines over the years.
                        Methodological Evolution

                        Compare and contrast research approaches across different time periods, emphasizing changes or advances in data collection, analysis techniques, or tools.
                        Identify and describe innovative methodological contributions and how these may have impacted research outcomes over time.
                        Theoretical Progression

                        Outline the theoretical foundations and highlight their chronological development.
                        Connect findings to existing theories, noting how interpretations or theoretical perspectives have evolved.
                        Identify theoretical advances, challenges, or shifts and their relationship to the timeline.
                        Practical Applications and Temporal Shifts

                        Discuss real-world applications over time, noting how findings have influenced industry practices or technology adoption.
                        Highlight evolving practical use cases and how implementation considerations have changed with advances in research.
                        Research Gaps and Future Directions

                        Identify limitations in studies across time periods, noting any improvement or persistent gaps.
                        Point out unexplored areas and suggest specific future research directions informed by chronological developments in the field.
                        Formatting and Style:

                        Organize the summary with clear sections that reflect the temporal progression.
                        Maintain an academic tone, using specific examples, dates, and quotes where relevant.
                        Clearly identify and label sections to enhance readability, and acknowledge any limitations in the available context.
